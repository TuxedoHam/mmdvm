# mmdvm
Stuff with `replace_me` needed to be changed for data relevent to your setup. 

## dmrgateway
Networks I am running is [`VK DMR`](https://vkdmr.com/) on TS1 and [`FreeDMR`](https://vkfreedmr.com/) on TS2 as I am running a duplex MMDVM on a RPi3B+.
All the configuring done to the `dmrgateway` file is either done via the web interface `http://pi-star/admin/expert/fulledit_dmrgateway.php` or logging in via ssh and using your fav editor eg `sudo nano /etc/dmrgateway`
